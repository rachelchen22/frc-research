# frc-research

This project, for my AP Research class, was completed over the course of 9 months in my senior year of high school: from August 2021 into May 2022.

The purpose of this research is to find and analyze the correlation between the median household incomes of various FRC teams with their overall season rank. This combined both socioeconomic aspects and data science techniques and aimed to fill gaps in research to provide explanation, suggestions, and future direction for what STEM programs around the nation, namely FIRST Robotics, can do to improve learning experiences for all.

I received a perfect score on the AP Research exam (1.14%).

This repository was created long after the class to follow better coding standards, as I learn more about what it means to be a software engineer. I appreciate your time :)
