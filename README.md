# frc-research

This project was completed over the course of 9 months, from August of 2021 into May 2022. The purpose of this research is to find and analyze the correlation between the median household incomes of various FRC teams with their overall season rank. This combined both socioeconomic aspects and data science techniques to fill gaps in research to provide explanation and suggestions on what STEM programs and competitions around the country, namely FIRST, can do to improve the learning experience of all students.

This was for my AP Research class. I received a perfect score later that summer and decided to create a repository for it, to maybe come back one day and see how my programming capabilities have evolved.

As always, I appreciate your time :)
